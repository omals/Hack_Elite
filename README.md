A Cash Flow Management Application
The idea behind a website called 'ESpende' is to manage personal finances in a more integrated way with many other functionalities.At present we often use banking
apps like GPay , PayTM etc for our day to day transactions.From these methodologies we are not in control of our expenditure.We always tend to spend money
unnecessarily.For all these above mentioned problems we met with a solution to built a cash flow management website.The idea is to bring a one hand mechanism
to remind the user about his expenditure and meet a money target of his/her own so that he/she can achieve it and gives a notification if the expense exceeds
a particular limit.

Main functionalities :

* In dashboard we can view finance news and present currency rates so that the user doesn't miss out on any finance related news.He can view everything at a
  glance.

* There is another module where user can see the stock market-rates of various companies so that he can plan out to buy stocks accordingly,if the user is
  interested.

* There is another functionality for the user to upload a .csv file of his bank statement.It plots the expenditure graph.It helps to visualize his expenditure.

* A piggy bank facility to save money towards a particular goal.If a user doesn't save the amount a reminder notification is sent.If he achieves the goal the
  reminder automatically turns off.


Stacks Used :

* Sreamlit
* Python

Set-up :
 
* install streamlit , plotly , yfinance , pandas , matplotlib libraries.

* Run the code using 'streamlit run filename.py'

Bugs/Errors :

* Due to non-availability of .csv file of bank data we used uber dataset from kaggle to show the visualization.

* Loading time of .csv file is high.

* Reminder in piggy bank facility not set properly.
